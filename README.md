# Bootstrap-Portfolio

As a new developer one of the things i will need is a portfolio to showcase my skills and my projects which i build throughout my career. This will be presented all in one place for future employers or even individuals to see what i am capable of. This project is a project which i am going to throughly come back to and chnage and update not just the projects aas i do new ones but also the layout. I learnt a lot about how flexbox works just from doing this project. Making this profile interactive and showcasing all my skills in one places is very neat. I have redone my profile but this time using bootstrap as a framework. I tried to keep as mcuh of the same elements as before.
